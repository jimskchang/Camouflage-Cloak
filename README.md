## **Why Camouflage Cloak**

First step in the cyber kill chain & MITRE&CK

Network reconnaissance stands the first stage of a cyber kill chain, where adversaries conduct host discovery, port scanning, and operating system detection in order to obtain critical information from remote hosts.

## **Why do we create Camouflage Cloak?**

Our primary purpose is to install a defensive deception solution on the target network, transparently sniffing malicious and normal traffic and forging the real host responses. DEFIC can mimic a target system to scrub the real identity of systems behind it.
