"""
This __init__.py file makes the 'src' directory a Python package.
It allows importing modules from 'src' such as settings, tcp, port_deceiver, os_deceiver, and Packet.

Enhancements:
- Proper exception handling for missing dependencies.
- Exposed key classes and functions for simplified imports.
- Ensured modules load properly even if dependencies are missing.
